## Recovery Instructions
If build fails or is interrupted:

1. **Check Last Completed Step**: Look for highest numbered ✅ step above
2. **Resume from Next Step**: Continue with first 📋 PENDING or ❌ FAILED step
3. **Restore Context**: Read Fallback.promptsupport.md files for context
4. **Validate Dependencies**: Ensure all dependency steps are completed

## Build Commands for Resume
```powershell
# Resume build from this manifest
$Manifest = Get-Content "Build-Steps/Manifest-Build-Progress.md.temp"
$LastCompleted = ($Manifest | Select-String "✅" | Measure-Object).Count
Write-Host "Resuming from step $($LastCompleted + 1)"
```

## Cleanup
When build is complete, remove this file and all .temp files:
```powershell
Remove-Item "Build-Steps/*.temp" -Force
```
